**Unit 4: Elizabethan Drama** <span id="4"></span> 
*Something electric happened to drama in Elizabethan England; the plays
from this era remain one of the richest, most widely-adored, and most
frequently-referenced bodies of literature in literary history.  In this
unit, we will examine the traditions from which Elizabethan dramatists
drew and the conventions, styles, and themes they developed in their own
right.  We will finish by spending a significant amount of time
acquainting ourselves with two of the era’s major dramatists:
Christopher Marlowe and the Bard himself, William Shakespeare.*
