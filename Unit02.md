**Unit 2: Prose and Polemical Writing** <span id="2"></span> 
*In this unit, we will acquaint ourselves with some of the most
noteworthy prose and polemical works of Renaissance-era England,
discussing their various rhetorical strategies and practices while
relating them to their historical contexts.  We will approach these
works by author rather than by subject in order to provide us with a
fuller portrait of the works in their respective contexts.*

**2.1 Thomas More** <span id="2.1"></span> 
*Note on the text: In* Utopia*, Thomas More imagines a society and its
various religious, social, and political customs as a means to criticize
and contrast the politics of his times.  As with many humanists, he is
interested in education and reform.*
