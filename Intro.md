Course Syllabus for "ENGL202: Cultural and Literary Expression in the English Renaissance"
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At the outset of the 16<sup>th</sup> century, Europeans tended to
dismiss English literature as inferior to continental literary
traditions; the educated Englishman was obliged to travel to the
continent and speak in other languages in order to “culture” himself. 
By the end of the Renaissance, however, some of the greatest works in
the English language—from Shakespeare’s dramas to Thomas More’s
*Utopia*—had been written.  In this course, we will read and examine
these works, situating them within their socio-historical and literary
contexts, while attempting to determine how the art of English language
and letters came into its own during this dynamic period. We will begin
with an overview of European history during the centuries leading up to
the Renaissance in order to acquaint ourselves with the profound
cultural and social changes brought about by the Italian Renaissance,
the Protestant Reformation, nationalism/colonialism, and the growing
power of the middle class.  We will then embark upon a genre study,
exploring various Renaissance-era achievements in poetry, drama, and
polemical writing.
