**Unit 1: Cultural and Historical Contexts** <span id="1"></span> 
*Let’s begin this course by taking stock of the various cultural and
historical developments that would shape and give rise to the literature
of the English Renaissance.  The period saw a number of dramatic changes
in politics (a number of chaotic transformations in monarchic governance
took place), religion (the Protestant Church split with the Catholic
faith), world power (England expanded its power in the New World), and
culture (the Italian Renaissance arrived!).  We will learn about each of
these developments in detail, relating them to one another and imagining
the influence that these changes would have on conceptualizations of the
self and the world.*
